The clearance between the huge 25-foot rotors and the stators of the two 75,000 kilowatt Shasta Dam generators, being installed at Grand Coulee Dam to make additional power available for war industries, is only 5/8 inch. Lowering this 450 ton wheel into place, the operators of the two powerhouse cranes, that jointly supported the load, were guided by workmen, stationed around the rim, who inserted sticks between the stationary and moving parts to measure the clearance and prevent contact. When the unit goes into service next February, the outer rim of this rotor, which is 7 feet high, will spin at 125 miles per hour. Attached to the rim are 52 magnets, weighing 3300 lbs. each.</event>

The bolts are five inches in diameter and 25 inches long. Each section of the two part shaft is provided with a flange, in which 16 holes have been bored. The bolts will be inserted in these openings, and the nuts, weighing 37 pounds each, attached. To tighten these, a huge steel wrench, three feet long, turned by the blows from a heavy sledge hammer, will be used. Before being seated, the bolts will be cooled to 80 below zero, and shrunk, in a compartment filled with dry ice. While in their contracted form, they will be inserted in the openings in the flanges of the shaft. When their temperature again rises and matches that of the surrounding atmosphere, the fit will be as near perfect as engineers are able to make it.</event>

Eight of these needle valves, transferred from Boulder Dam, are being temporarily installed in the turbine pits by use of steel reducers (elbows) joining the valve with the 18-foot in diameter penstock tubes. A portion of the stream flow of the Columbia River is to be passed through those needle valves during the low water season. The flow through the needle valves, in addition to that portion of the river flow passing through the turbines in the left power house will make unnecessary the use of the spillway. This program of diversion will provide a minimum of turbulence in the water at the foot of the spillway section, facilitating future repair work to the concrete bucket or trough at the base of the spillway. At some future date, the needle valves will be replaced by 150,000 horsepower hydro-turbines, designed to propel 108,000 kilowatt hydroelectric generators.</event>

Contractor: Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc. and Peter Kiewit Sons' Company. This aerial view of the Grand Coulee Dam area shows the status of progress on the construction of Grand Coulee pumping plant and feeder canal. The pumping plant is being constructed behind the 600-foot long wing dam extending to the left from near the west abutment end of Grand Coulee Dam. The world's largest pumps will be installed in the pumping plant at a level of 120 feet below the roadway elevation. Each pump will lift water 280 feet from Roosevelt Lake and will discharge it through a steel pipe 12 feet in diameter and about 680 feet in length. Twelve tunnels, from 487 to 530 feet in length, will carry the pipes under the highway and up through the granite canyon wall. Upon emerging from the tunnels, as do the three pipes on the right, they will continue on concrete piers for about 260 feet and discharge into the headworks for the feeder canal. Excavation of the feeder canal has been completed to the cut-and -cover section and is ready for concrete lining.</event>
