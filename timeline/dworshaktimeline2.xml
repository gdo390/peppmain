        McElwee was on the program before Resource managers, explaining the project. He was a fine
        Col. and a very smart one. He was great but took a beating when he wanted to not replace the
        railroad from Lewiston down the Snake River to the Snake River dams. In this instance I
        (Curtis) had to take the other side and work for the re-location of the railroad down-stream
        from Lewiston. I think he got his orders from high-up, however, and readily agreed when
        things turned against him. He is now is New York with. Con. Ed. and has a great job with
        lots of responsibility. (A.B. Curtis - 1976)""</event>

        construction type of bridge and we were working with the State Highway to get it to be a
        bridge for public use. Army wanted it to haul cement and route for workers to come to the
        job- a saving for labor transportation, etc. The state was to put some money into it and
        make it a public bridge, the Army wanted to tear it down after construction. To make a long
        story short, the state was willing but the Army backed out of the deal and elected to divert
        the travel across the bridge at Orofino rather than go to the expense of a new bridge. The
        markings are Army. This shows the forks of the river well. (A.B. Curtis)""</event>
