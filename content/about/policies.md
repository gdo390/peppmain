## Scanning and Preservation Procedures
Scans are performed and saved as non-compressed Tiffs and stored on two external hard drives, one of which resides in Moscow and one of which resides in Coeur D'Alene. TIFFs are also backed up to the internal hard drive of computers in the Lau Center for Digital Scholarship, room 211.

Variable scanning resolutions are described below. The primary purpose is to have approximately 4000 pixels across the top of the image for images smaller than 8 x 10, and 6000 pixels for images 8 x 10 and greater.

### Manuscripts/Documents:
- 8 X 11 paper - 400 dpi
- Pieces of paper smaller than 5 x 7 are scanned at 600 dpi

### Photographs, Slides & Negatives:
- All photographs are scanned in color
- 8 x 10 and up scan at 400-600 dpi
- Images between 5 x 7 to 8 x 10 scan at 400-600 dpi
- 5 x 7 down to 3 x 5 scan at 600 dpi
- Smaller than 3 x 5 scan at 1200 dpi

### 3D objects:
- All 3D objects are photographed at 400-600 dpi
- When possible photograph various sides of the object
- Photograph a close up of significant details on the object that add to its value

### Feed Scanner:
- We scan larger documents using our feed scanner
- Pages are scanned anywhere from 400 - 600 dpi

## Metadata Guidelines

Since we are using the CONTENTdm database access management system, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is the primary source of our metadata standards. Metadata for objects begins following the needs of the collection. When ingested into CONTENTdm, those idiosyncratic standards are translated into Simple Dublin Core to enable the harvesting of that metadata into OCLC's WorldCat catalog and other aggregators.
