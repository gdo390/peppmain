<h1 class="py-4">About CollectionBuilder</h1>

Most of our digital collections are generated using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/), an open source minimal infrastructure platform that we at the University of Idaho have developed.

CollectionBuilder is driven by metadata and powered by static-web technology, so it's intuitive for librarians to use, customizable, and secure. CollectionBuilder facilitates multiple modes of entry into a digital collection: librarians need only upload a spreadsheet of well-curated data and digital files. Using these, CollectionBuilder automatically generates timelines, maps, word clouds in addition to comprehensive item pages. By separating the data from the platform, CollectionBuilder makes it easy for collections to be preserved and shared. Following a Collections as Data model, CollectionBuilder generates collection data files in multiple formats for patrons to download and explore.

The University of Idaho Digital Collections are created using a version of CollectionBuilder that acts as a "skin" for our digital library collections that are maintained via a hosted CONTENTdm instance.

Simple yet powerful, CollectionBuilder ensures that digital curation and preservation is in the hands of librarians. Read more about CollectionBuilder's minimal-computing approach at [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/).

The University of Idaho's Digital Initiatives team have received a 2019 Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) [National Leadership Grant for Libraries](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19) to develop and promote CollectionBuilder.
