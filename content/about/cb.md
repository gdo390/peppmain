<h1 class="py-4">About CollectionBuilder</h1>

Most of our digital collections are generated using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io), an open source minimal infrastructure platform developed by a team of librarians at the University of Idaho.

CollectionBuilder is driven by metadata and powered by static-web technology, so it's intuitive for librarians to use, lightweight, customizable, and secure. CollectionBuilder requires only a simple spreadsheet of metadata and a directory of digital objects to facilitate multiple modes of entry into a digital collection by generating timelines, maps, and browsing features that contextualize the collection's historic items. Following a Collections as Data model, CollectionBuilder also generates collection data files in multiple formats for researchers and patrons to download and explore.

The University of Idaho Digital Collections are created using a version of CollectionBuilder that acts as a "skin" on top of our digital library collections that are maintained via a hosted CONTENTdm instance.

Simple yet powerful, CollectionBuilder ensures that digital curation and preservation is in the hands of librarians. Read more about CollectionBuilder's minimal-computing approach at <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>.

The University of Idaho's Digital Initiatives team received a 2019 Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) [National Leadership Grant for Libraries](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19) to develop and promote CollectionBuilder.
