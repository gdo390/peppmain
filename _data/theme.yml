# Home page
home-title-y-padding: 12em # the margin from the top your title portion will appear
mediatypes: images; #options[documents,images,video,sound,data] separate semi-colon(';'). If semi-colon is present, the browse items on the browse page will display a type field. If only one media type (and thus no semi-colon), no type field will display

# Browse page
# see _data/browse-config.csv for field display options
# fields given the "btn" option can be multivalued with ";" such as subjects.

# Item page 
browse-buttons: false # true / false, adds previous/next arrows to items, but doubles build time

map-cluster-radius: 25 # size of clusters, from ~ 10 to 80

# Subject page
subjects-off: false # true / false, turns off subject generation to lower dev build time (then page doesn't work!)

stopwords: # set of subjects separated by ;, e.g. boxers;boxing

# Locations page
locations-on: false

# About page
