Note on back: 'During the planning stages we wanted a bridge across the main river just below Ahsahka. It was to be an Army construction type of bridge and we were working with the State Highway  to get it to be a bridge for public use. Army wanted it to haul  cement and route for workers to come to the job- a saving for labor transportation, etc. The state was to put some money into it and make it a public bridge, the Army wanted to tear it down after construction. To make a long story short, the state was willing but the Army backed out of the deal and elected to divert the travel across the bridge at Orofino rather than go to the expense of a new bridge. The markings are Army. This shows the forks of the river well. (A.B. Curtis)'",1965, road; bridge; 1965,"PG 13, A.B.
